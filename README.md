## Problem Statment

Saudi Arabia recorded the highest death rate in traffic accidents in G20 country for traffic accidents and traffic accidents have become a leading cause of death for children and young people aged 5 to 29 years around the world, exceeding HIV and tuberculosis that show us how much we need to take action to reduce the number of accidents.


## Data dictionary

We have two datasets one for traffic accidents between 2016 and 2017 we called i and the other is for number of driving licenses between(1993-2017)

|Feature|Type|Dataset|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|**year**|*int*|accidents|The year of recorded data.| 
|**region**|*object*|accidents|The region where the data recorded |
|**indicator**|*object*|accidents|Represent the types of accidents including types of Casualties(injured or dead) |

|**geo_point_2d**|*object*|accidents|The geographical coordinates of the region|
|**x**|*float*|accidents|Represent x_coordinates of the region |
|**y**|*float*|accidents|Represent y_coordinates of the region|

|Feature|Type|Dataset|Description|

|**year**|*int*|licenses|The year of recorded data.| 
|**region**|*object*|licenses|The region where the data recorded |
|**driving_licenses**|*int*|licenses|The number of driving licenses issued|

## Executive summary


In this project we analysed the data so we can solve the problem that we have in Saudi Arabia that is the high number of accidents.
From the data we can see that number of accidents in 2017 is less than 2016 and almost all the region have thier number of accidents decrease in 2017 or stayed similar to 2016 except Makkah increased almost 10000 accidents.


## Conclusions/Recommendations

What can we recommend from the expolration of the data and outside research is that:

1.From the outside research we saw that the new penalties implemented in 2016 has a positive affect on number of accidents in 2017 

2.And for Makkah we saw the new penalties didn't reduced the number of accidents, and as i mentioned before according to the data in general general authority for statistics(https://www.stats.gov.sa/en/6008) we see that number of violations in makkah is significantly higher than any region so at the moment we recommend awareness campaign in schools or in the street also we can use social media which proved to be affective in reaching and influence people.
